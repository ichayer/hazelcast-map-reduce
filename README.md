# Instalation
Run this command to compile the project with `Maven`:
```bash
mvn clean install
```
Extract `tar.gz` from `target` folders:
```bash
mkdir -p tmp/csv && find . -name '*tar.gz' -exec tar -C tmp -xzf {} \;
find . -path './tmp/tpe2-g4-*/*' -exec chmod u+x {} \;
```
This will extract the generated `.tar.gz` files, storing them in a temporary directory `./tmp`, and grant execution permissions to both the client and server `.sh` files. It will also create a `csv` folder to place CSVs in it.

Sample scripts are provided in the `scripts` folder. Update script flags values to match your environment.

> Note: these scripts MUST be executed from the root of the project and they must use absolute paths. An easy way to do this is replacing `"./output.txt"` with `"$PWD/output.txt"`
